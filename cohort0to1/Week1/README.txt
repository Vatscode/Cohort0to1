Single threaded nature of JS

Unlike java,c++,rust js is not multi threaded meaning you cannot run two node js files at one time without using more then one core in cpu,
** The more core a machine has the more things/processes you can run on it.
** Context switching is when your applications/processes dont require cpu at all times so it switches context between different things
** JS only uses one core at a time unlike java 
*** You can use cluster model to make java multi threading.
** Functions can take other functions as input (callback functions) //fnToCall
